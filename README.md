### Problem statement
https://canvas.uva.nl/courses/45979/assignments/537062

The assignment is to analyse a dataset composed of the corpus of texts of UN General Debate statements from 1946 (Session 1) to 2024 (Session 79) and relate it with other datasets (e.g., the Happiness Report or the International Trade Dataset used in Lab 2). The United Nations General Debate Corpus is available online Links to an external site. and you can gain extra insight about its contents by reading this paper (pdf here Download [here](https://www.un.org/en/high-level-week-2024/#GAD)).

The goal of this assignment is to perform an exploratory data analysis (i.e., **data collection, data pre-processing, combination of datasets, descriptive statistics, and visualisation**) and predictive analysis (i.e., **model selection, training and validation**). You are expected to apply statistical learning methods and report obtained coefficients and/or validation metrics. You are expected to first gather information about the dataset (i.e., read the introductory paper and dataset documentation; inspect some of the entries in the data set; inspect the Happiness Report Dataset, International Trade Dataset or others) and formulate and answer questions that you would like to explore.

You should pose **one exploratory** and **one predictive** question. Ideally, the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** should allow to refine your predictive question. You will be required to clean and pre-process the textual data in a suitable way. Note that these multiple tasks can inspire an efficient division of labour for each of the group elements to focus on.
