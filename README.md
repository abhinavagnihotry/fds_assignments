# Fundamentals of Data Science: Assignment 2 Repository

## Problem Statement

### Assignment Focus:
This assignment addresses two key questions:

1. **Can we predict missing links in a social network?**
2. **What are the ethical implications of link prediction?**

### Assignment Breakdown:
The assignment is divided into two parts:

- **Part 1**: Develop a supervised learning algorithm for link prediction (50%).
- **Part 2**: Write an essay reflecting on the ethical aspects of your link prediction solution (50%).

### Background:
Networks are dynamic, and we often work with incomplete data about their connections. The fundamental problem of **link prediction** is to infer missing or future connections between nodes in a network using the available data on network structure and nodes.

#### Applications of Link Prediction:
- **Recommendation Systems**: Suggest products, movies, or content to users based on inferred links in user-item networks.
- **Biology**: Predict interactions between proteins, aiding in drug discovery and biological process understanding.
- **Genetics**: Forecast potential genetic interactions or pathways.
- **Transportation**: Predict transportation demand to improve urban planning and traffic management.
- **Finance**: Detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Criminal Networks**: Identify missing links to assist investigators.

This assignment focuses on **link prediction in social networks**, where nodes represent people and links represent social connections (e.g., friendships, family ties, professional collaborations).

### Suggested Reading:
Review the Week 4 suggested reading on one of the first scientific papers addressing link prediction in social networks. It provides valuable insights into the problem and possible solutions.

### Insights from Social Sciences:
Research reveals important patterns in social networks that support link prediction:

- **Clustering Coefficient**: Social networks have a high clustering coefficient, meaning that if two individuals share a common friend, they are likely connected.
- **Homophily**: Connected individuals tend to be similar.
- **Community Structure**: Social networks exhibit well-defined communities, which may be useful for feature engineering when predicting social links.
